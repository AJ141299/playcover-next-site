# Inspiration

After developing and launching the first version of the website using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS, we received positive feedback from the user-base, however, soon it became apparent that maintaining and scaling the project consumes much more time than we anticipated, given the fact that we support 5 languages other than English. Hence, I began looking into components-based libraries such as React, and was able to rewrite the entire website in about a week. While creating this new version, a major issue of bad SEO performance arose, being a single-page-application. To counter this, Next.js was introduced in the project and server-side generation was enabled.
